# Plant Health Evaluator – Planning & Systems Design Repository

## Overview
This repository documents the **planning, system design, and development workflow** for an AI-based **Plant Health Evaluator**.  
The project combines **machine learning** and **IoT hardware (ESP32-CAM)** to assess the health of tomato plants using image data.

The goal is to create a complete end-to-end system capable of:
1. Capturing real-time plant images via the ESP32-CAM
2. Analyzing key health indicators with a deep learning model
3. Producing a quantitative “plant health score” based on color, size, wilting, and disease
